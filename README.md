# Personal Loan Classification in Banking
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

The classification goal is to build a model which will be used to predict which customer will most likely to accept the offer for personal loan, based on the specific relationship with the bank across various features given in the dataset.
